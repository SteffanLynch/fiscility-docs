Hey guys,

I’ve been working on a new fintech project called Fiscility for the past 18 months.

As a former data analyst, I couldn't find anything to give me the same depth of financial reporting and analytics I was doing for work. Most apps focused on budgeting or basic metrics, but none of them gave me the kind of centralised, comprehensive, analytics I was used to working with.

So I had a go at building it myself.

Right now it:

Sends daily, weekly, and monthly reports to your email and SMS inbox

Has an advanced dashboard with 5 tabs of analytics and trends

Lets you view transactions across multiple bank accounts in one place (US & Canada via Plaid)

I'm asking for a group of beta testers (20 max) for their honest feedback and thoughts to validate the product. It’ll be completely free for the first 3 months, and anyone who helps test will get 70% off forever afterwards — as a thank-you for supporting early.

I live in the UK, but the app currently only works with US/Canada accounts. If you'd like to help out, just drop a comment or DM me and I’ll send you a link.

Thanks
— Steffan (Founder of Fiscility)
