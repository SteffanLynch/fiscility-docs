## Orientation: Why This Partnership Works

**What Fiscility is:** a personal finance analytics platform that connects to bank accounts (via Plaid), analyzes transactions, and sends clear weekly/monthly reports by email or SMS, plus a simple dashboard for on-demand visibility.

**Why partners use it:** it adds tangible value to clients with almost no extra work. You introduce it; Fiscility handles onboarding, product support, and ongoing delivery. You remain the trusted advisor.

**Your outcomes:**

* 20% recurring commission on every active client subscription you introduce.
* Stronger client retention and differentiation (you’re bringing proactive insights, not just compliance).
* Repeatable referral system you can run every month.

**Incentives & guarantees (program settings):**

* Launch bonus: first 10 partners who bring 3+ clients in their first 30 days receive a \$500 bonus.
* 90-day revenue guarantee: if your total commissions are under \$2,000 by Day 90 and you completed the activation steps in this guide, we make up the difference.
  *(Replace with your final policy if you change this.)*

## The Offer You’ll Share With Clients

**Plain-English pitch (use verbatim if helpful):**
“Fiscility helps you stay on top of your money without spreadsheets or complex tools. You connect your bank in about two minutes, and you’ll start getting clear weekly or monthly summaries by email or text. You can also log in to a simple dashboard any time. There’s a 14-day free trial, and you can cancel any time.”

**What clients get:**

* Secure bank connection via Plaid (2 minutes).
* Automated weekly/monthly reports via email or SMS.
* Clean dashboard for trends and cash flow.
* No long-term commitments; cancel any time.
* 14-day free trial.

**Plans:**
Free (Intern), \$29 (Accountant), \$49 (Analyst), \$79 (CFO).
*(You can keep pricing off your message if you prefer Fiscility to present it.)*

**Important note for partners:** this is **not** a white-label platform. You receive unbranded client-facing materials (deck/one-pager) you can present; Fiscility provides the product and support under the Fiscility brand.

## How to Talk About Fiscility (Positioning, Talk Tracks, Dos/Don’ts)

**Positioning in one line:**
“Clarity and control on autopilot — delivered between our meetings.”

**30-second talk track:**
“I’m recommending a tool called Fiscility that gives you clear weekly or monthly financial summaries by email/text and a simple dashboard. You’ll connect your bank once and that’s it. It’s made for busy owners who want visibility without more work. There’s a 14-day free trial — want to try it?”

**Two-minute overview:**

* Why: most clients are juggling accounts and don’t have a reliable way to see trends in real time.
* What: Fiscility connects securely to your bank accounts via Plaid, organizes transactions, and sends insights on a schedule you choose; dashboard is there when you need it.
* How: you get a link, connect in a couple of minutes, and you’ll start receiving summaries.
* Value: fewer surprises, faster decisions, more confidence — without adding tasks to your week.

**Dos:**

* Speak to outcomes (clarity, time saved, fewer “where did the money go?” moments).
* Keep friction low (trial, cancel anytime).
* Offer to send the one-pager or invite link immediately.

**Don’ts:**

* Don’t oversell features or use technical jargon.
* Don’t promise results you don’t control (e.g., “you’ll increase revenue 20%”).
* Don’t discuss your commission with clients.

---

## Ideal Clients & Discovery Cues

**Profiles that convert well:**

* Service businesses with variable monthly cash flow (agencies, consultants, trades).
* Solo or small teams with multiple bank/credit accounts.
* Owners who repeatedly ask, “Where is the money going?”
* Anyone not regularly logging into accounting software or ignoring standard reports.

**Discovery cues to listen for:**

* “I hate logging into my bank/apps.”
* “We catch issues too late.”
* “My reports are confusing.”
* “I want a quick snapshot weekly.”
* “I’m guessing on cash flow.”

**When to introduce Fiscility:**

* During routine check-ins, when cash flow or spending comes up.
* After a surprise expense month.
* When an owner asks for “a simple way” to stay on top of finances.

## Your First 30 Days: Step-by-Step Plan

**Goal for Month 1:** 3–5 activated clients and a repeatable rhythm you can run monthly.

### Week 1 — Prepare and Invite

* [ ] Review the Client Pitch Deck and 1-Pager.
* [ ] Create a shortlist of 5–10 ideal clients.
* [ ] Send the first 3 invites using the email template below.
* [ ] Log each outreach in the Partner Tracker Sheet.
* [ ] Schedule a 7-day follow-up for each invitee.

**Expected outcome:** first trial started.

### Week 2 — Follow Up and Activate

* [ ] Follow up with anyone who didn’t respond (see follow-up templates).
* [ ] Offer to resend the one-pager or short demo video.
* [ ] Answer light questions; direct product questions to Fiscility support.
* [ ] Add 2–3 more invites from your shortlist.

**Expected outcome:** 1–2 clients activated and receiving reports.

### Week 3 — Leverage Wins

* [ ] Ask active clients for a brief quote on their experience so far.
* [ ] Share one anonymized win with another client who hesitated.
* [ ] Add 2–3 more invites if capacity allows.

**Expected outcome:** social proof, second wave of activations.

### Week 4 — Consolidate and Plan Next Month

* [ ] Ensure all active clients are receiving reports reliably.
* [ ] Review your tracker: outreach volume, responses, signups, actives.
* [ ] Set next month’s target (another 3–5 clients).
* [ ] Optional: ask active clients if anyone else on their team would benefit.

**Expected outcome:** 3–5 active clients; rhythm established.

## Client Objections & Confident Responses

1. “I already use QuickBooks/Xero.”
   **Response:** “Great — Fiscility doesn’t replace that. It interprets the numbers and sends simple summaries between our meetings. They work well together.”

2. “I don’t want another subscription.”
   **Response:** “Understood. Most clients find that catching waste and trends early more than pays for it. The trial lets you see this firsthand.”

3. “Is this secure?”
   **Response:** “Bank connection uses Plaid, used by many major apps. Your credentials aren’t shared with Fiscility. We only access the transaction data needed for your summaries.”

4. “I’m too busy to set it up.”
   **Response:** “Setup is a single connection that takes about two minutes. After that, it’s hands-off.”

5. “Will I actually read the reports?”
   **Response:** “They’re designed to be glanceable and actionable. Most clients read them in under a minute.”

6. “My finances are unique; will it work for me?”
   **Response:** “It’s built to handle typical small-business patterns. If it doesn’t help within 14 days, you can cancel.”

7. “Can you just tell me what’s going on?”
   **Response:** “I can give guidance, but this keeps you informed between our conversations so we can make better decisions together.”

8. “What if it pulls the wrong transactions?”
   **Response:** “If anything looks off, contact support and they’ll help reconcile. You can also adjust how you interpret trends going forward.”

9. “What if I change banks?”
   **Response:** “You can reconnect a new account at any time.”

10. “What happens if I cancel?”
    **Response:** “Your reports stop. There’s no penalty or lock-in.”

**Payout method:** Stripe/ACH (confirm your payout details in your partner profile).

## Metrics, Benchmarks & Simple Pipeline Math

**Useful benchmarks (Month 1):**

* Outreach to response: 30–40%
* Response to trial: 30–50%
* Trial to paid: 60–80%
* Net from first 10 invites: 3–5 active clients

**Planning example:**
Invite 10 clients → 4 reply → 2–3 trial → 2 become active.
Repeat weekly with small batches to compound.

**What “good” looks like by Day 30:**

* 3–5 active clients
* 6–10 total trials started

## Templates: Emails, Messages & Follow-ups

**Initial email to a client (short):**
Subject: Quick way to stay on top of cash flow
Body:
“Thought of you. I’m recommending a simple tool called Fiscility that sends clear weekly/monthly summaries by email or text and gives you a clean dashboard. You connect your bank once (2 minutes) and that’s it. There’s a 14-day trial. Want me to send the invite?”

**Alternate email (slightly longer):**
Subject: A simpler way to see where the money goes
Body:
“I’ve been testing a tool called Fiscility for clients who want visibility without spreadsheets. It connects via Plaid, sends concise weekly/monthly summaries, and has a simple dashboard. No long setup, cancel any time. If you’d like to try it, I’ll send an invite — there’s a 14-day free trial.”

**Two-line LinkedIn/DM:**
“Quick one — I’m recommending Fiscility to clients who want a weekly snapshot of cash flow without logging into anything. Two-minute bank connect, 14-day trial. Want the link?”

**Follow-up #1 (Day 3–4):**
“Circling back on Fiscility — happy to send a one-pager or the invite link if you want to try it this month. It takes about two minutes to connect.”

**Follow-up #2 (Day 7–8):**
“Sharing a quick win: another client spotted a spending trend in week one and made a fast adjustment. If you want the trial link, I can send it now.”

**Trial activation nudge:**
“Noticed you started a trial — great. If any part of the setup isn’t clear, reply here and the Fiscility team will get you sorted.”

**Post-activation check-in (Day 10–14):**
“Have the weekly summaries been helpful so far? If anything looks off, support will fix it quickly. If you want to adjust the cadence, that’s easy too.”
