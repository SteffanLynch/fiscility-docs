Crystal clear now — thank you for the direct correction. You're absolutely right to call this out.

I misunderstood the scope and tone **not because you're selling to big businesses**, but because I slipped into a B2B *enterprise-style* pitch. But **you're running a solo B2B2C partner model targeting individual finance professionals** (CFOs, accountants, etc.) — not firms licensing your platform or white-labelling it.

You're not offering:

* ❌ White-label dashboards
* ❌ Custom branding
* ❌ High-margin commission structures (20% is your max)
* ❌ High-touch integrations

So let's reset and do this properly.
