## Fiscility's Philosophy
**These are the values and philosophies that Fiscility is built on. Our target audience are those that agree and believe in our philoshophy.**

* What you dont measure, you dont care about - If you care about your finances, you must track and measure key metrics

* Time saved is money well spent - Anything you can pay for that will save you time to do more important things and make more money is a worthy investment.

* Your money is reflection of you - Your financial management and behaviour is a reflection of you. Make sure it's a good one.

* Your best decisions are the most informed ones - The more complete information and context you, the better decisions, you'll inevitably make.

* Different groups all part of the same tribe - Members of Fiscility have different backgrounds, and are on different paths, but we all have the same goal and mission for financial clarity and understanding.

* Only as complicated as it needs to be - Making things only as complex and difficult as they need to be and no more. We prefer things clear, direct and simple. 

## Fiscility as a Business
**These are rules that we will employ internally and the way in reach we want to build and run Fiscility. This defines the entity that is Fiscility and how it moves, breathes, live and behaves.**

* Fiscility is not for everyone; only for those that get in/it - I want Fiscility to have a mutual and symbiotic relationship with its customers/members. and therefore, I only want qualified members who wont cause headache or problems or be a bottleneck in the growth. All our members must be in the same direction and philosophy as Fisciility with shared interest. We'd rather have a few a of high quality, than many of low. For example, not our ideal customer if we have to explain what "CFO" stands for or the value of financial reporting.

* We are something to show off and brag about - If you do not absolutely love and join Fiscility, you should not be a part of us. We dont need customers or members who arent excited about us. We want to be something that our members are excited about and can brag about to their friends and family. We're here to be absolutely remarkable.

* We dont need to sell or entice people. Just present and let them decide - We dont need to force or entice people to join us. Those who want us, want us and those who dont, don't. That way, when people do join us, we can be confident in their retention and long term comitment. 

* We are a movement, a brand, a change. - Fiscility is more than a commercial business. It's a movement and a brand. We aren't just here to make money. We're here to bring about an impact. We aren't looking to compete in the market, we're looking to craft our own.

* Our customers aren't customers, they're members - They're a part of the Fiscility famility and tribe. They're the spotlight. We celeberate their wins and treat them like they're aspirational, so that non-members aspire to be (like) them. Send them a certificate of authenticity when they sign up. Post their wins on our brand social media. Create case studies about them, etc etc.

* Relationship above all - Focus on extraordinary support. Personal onboarding call with myself as the founder when they sign up and connect their accounts. Sp that they feel familiar with Fiscility, they feel a part of the brand and not just a consumer.

* We're here for the long game, not the short play

* We're here to stand out, not fit in - We're not competiting against other fintech apps. We're creating a market of our own. Whatever other business conventions and marketing norms that others are abiding by and expecting, we are looking to do the complete opposite and make our stance. We must be comparable to no one and no thing.
