# B2B (Partner Sales — book calls)

**Subject:** Book qualified partner calls for Fiscility (commission-based)

Hi \[Name],
I’m a solo founder launching **Fiscility**—a personal-finance analytics platform with automated email/SMS reports and a clear dashboard. Paid plans are **\$29–\$79/month**. I’m ready to launch/test now, but I don’t have an existing lead list, network, or sales funnel.

I’m looking for a sales freelancer to **source and qualify potential partners** (e.g. accountants, bookkeepers, finance coaches, fractional CFOs) and **book calls** with me. I’ll handle demos, pricing, onboarding, and support; you focus on outreach and scheduling qualified meetings.

Could you reply with:

* Whether you can help
* Your **expected call-booking targets** (e.g. per week)
* Your **ideas/thoughts** on channels and approach
* Your **preferred payment model and price** (commission-only or retainer + commission)

Thanks,
\[Your Name]

# B2C (Direct Sales — close sign-ups)

**Subject:** Close consumer sign-ups for Fiscility (\$29–\$79/mo)

Hi \[Name],
I’m launching **Fiscility**, a personal-finance analytics app that centralises accounts, sends automated email/SMS reports, and makes money clarity simple. Paid plans are **\$29–\$79/month**. I’m ready to go live but have **no existing audience or funnel**.

I need a hands-on sales freelancer to **drive and close paid consumer sign-ups**—owning outreach, demos (or booking them with me), and closing. I’ll provide materials, onboarding, and support.

Please share:

* Whether you can help
* Your **expected conversion targets** (e.g. sign-ups per week)
* Your **ideas/thoughts** on channels and approach
* Your **preferred payment model and price** (commission-only or retainer + commission)

Thanks,
\[Your Name]
