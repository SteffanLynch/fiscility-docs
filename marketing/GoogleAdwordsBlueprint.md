# Blueprint for High-Converting Google Search Ads (AdWords)

Search Ads target users with **high intent** and require hyper-relevance (high Quality Score) to be cost-effective.

---

## 1. Account Structure (Maximizing Quality Score)

* **Tightly Themed Ad Groups:** Structure Ad Groups around very specific topics or sets of keywords (Single Topic Ad Groups - STAGs).
    * **Goal:** Ensure the Ad Copy directly uses the keyword, maximizing **Quality Score** and lowering Cost Per Click (CPC).
* **Targeting for Fiscility:** Focus on keywords indicating pain or specific solution seeking.
    * **Example Topic 1 (Pain):** `consolidate bank accounts app`, `financial reporting headache`, `automate financial reports`
    * **Example Topic 2 (Solution):** `best daily finance summary tool`, `sms bank reports`
* **Landing Page Alignment:** Each Ad Group's ad copy must lead to the one hyper-relevant landing page URL.
