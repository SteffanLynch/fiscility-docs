### **1️⃣ Start with curated professional directories (less noise than LinkedIn)**

These are already filtered for legitimacy — and almost every profile links to a website.

| Directory                                                                                                                 | Why It Works                                                                            | Search Tip                                                                        |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Xero Advisor Directory** → [advisor.xero.com](https://advisor.xero.com)                                                 | Thousands of small accounting firms using Xero; includes site, region, and client size. | Filter by *Country → United States / Canada* and *Industry focus: small business* |
| **QuickBooks ProAdvisor** → [quickbooks.intuit.com/find-an-accountant](https://quickbooks.intuit.com/find-an-accountant/) | Verified accountants & bookkeepers; all have public listings + websites.                | Filter by “Online only” or your target region.                                    |
| **Paro.io Professionals** → [paro.io](https://www.paro.io)                                                                | Fractional CFOs, bookkeepers, controllers.                                              | Many list personal websites or firm pages.                                        |
| **Clarity.fm Experts** → [clarity.fm](https://clarity.fm)                                                                 | Coaches & consultants offering finance/business advice.                                 | Filter by Category → “Finance & Accounting”.                                      |
| **Alignable** → [alignable.com](https://www.alignable.com)                                                                | Local SMB service providers.                                                            | Search “accountant” + “Canada” / “USA” and read bios; most have business URLs.    |

✅ These are goldmines: small, visible, and already vetted by a platform.
Manually shortlist 20–30 firms from here before touching LinkedIn again.

---

### **2️⃣ Mine existing affiliate & directory pages**

Sometimes the best partners are already listed publicly by others.

| Source                                    | Example                                                           | What to Do                                                                                               |
| ----------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Software partner directories**          | e.g., “Gusto Partners,” “Wave Advisors,” “FreshBooks Accountants” | Copy names and sites from those lists — they’re active digital accountants.                              |
| **Finance coaches from course platforms** | Skillshare / Podia / Teachable                                    | Search “Finance Coach” or “Money Management” creators — they *all* have personal websites.               |
| **Newsletter writers**                    | Substack, Beehiiv                                                 | Search Substack for “Money,” “Finance,” “Business Clarity.” Filter by writers who list consulting links. |

✅ These people already have websites and an online audience — perfect for your /partners showcase.

---

### **3️⃣ Use smarter LinkedIn + Google combo searches**

Sales Navigator can be noisy because people don’t fill out profiles fully.
Instead, use **Google X-Ray searches** that *leverage LinkedIn but return website-rich results.*

Try searches like:

```
site:linkedin.com/in "fractional CFO" ("founder" OR "owner") ("United States" OR "Canada") "finance"
```

or

```
"financial coach" ("my clients" OR "help people") -life -MLM -network site:linkedin.com/in
```

and when you find someone good → click “Visit Website” directly (usually in About section or Experience).

✅ You can gather 10x better leads this way than pure LinkedIn filters.

### **4️⃣ Scrape / curate from content platforms (with websites guaranteed)**

| Platform                             | Filter                                                           | Example                                                             |
| ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **YouTube**                          | Search “financial coach for small business,” filter by <50k subs | They almost always have links in bio to their site or course.       |
| **Podcasts**                         | ListenNotes.com search “small business finance”                  | Pull guest names; most guests have websites.                        |
| **Medium / Indie Hackers / Gumroad** | Search “finance coach,” “bookkeeping templates,” etc.            | You’ll find solo operators with legit audiences and business pages. |

Build a spreadsheet of 30–50 names, URLs, and notes on niche focus.

---

### **5️⃣ Reverse-engineer from accountants’ testimonials**

Search on Google for phrases like:

```
“client testimonials” “accounting firm” site:.com
```

or

```
"boutique accounting" "testimonials" "small business"
```

→ these pages are usually modern small-firm sites, perfect for featuring.

## 🧩 Practical filters that actually work (on any platform)

When shortlisting, use these as non-negotiables:

| Criterion                  | Requirement                                                           | Why                                     |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **Website present**        | Must have a live, modern site (Squarespace, Wix, WordPress fine).     | Confirms legitimacy and brand effort.   |
| **Active online presence** | Last post within 60–90 days.                                          | Avoid dead firms.                       |
| **Niche clarity**          | “Small business,” “solopreneur,” or “high-income professional” focus. | Aligns with your member base.           |
| **Tone alignment**         | Professional, helpful, not salesy or MLM-adjacent.                    | Matches Fiscility’s calm, quality tone. |
| **Size**                   | 2–15 employees or solo operator.                                      | Small enough to appreciate exposure.    |

If they meet 3+ of these, they’re partnership-worthy.

## ⚙️ Suggested workflow

1. **Pick two primary pipelines** (e.g., Xero Directory + YouTube creators).
2. Export 20–30 leads into a simple Google Sheet:
   | Name | Role | Website | Country | Fit Type | Contact Email | Status |
3. Add those to Sanity CMS → status = “Pending Confirmation”.
4. Then send your existing “We’ve featured you” letter to 5 per day.

You’ll have 25–30 credible profiles live within 2 weeks.

## 🎯 Bonus: keywords & niches that convert well

Use these when searching directories or Google:

| Segment                  | Search Phrase                                   |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Personal finance coaches | “financial coach for professionals”             |
| Business advisors        | “cash flow coach for small business”            |
| Accountants              | “boutique accounting firm” / “cloud accountant” |
| CFOs                     | “fractional CFO for startups”                   |
| Creators                 | “finance educator site:substack.com”            |
| Bookkeepers              | “virtual bookkeeping firm USA”                  |

---

### TL;DR

**Stop:** relying solely on LinkedIn filters — too much noise, too few websites.
**Start:** sourcing from verified directories (Xero, QuickBooks), curated content creators, and small-firm websites you find via Google/YouTube.
**Use:** a consistent shortlist workflow → vet manually for tone + legitimacy → feature → send your letter.
