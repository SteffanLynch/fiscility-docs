## 📖 Overview

This document explains the **structure, purpose, and strategy** behind Fiscility’s tagline system.

2. **Theme (creative tone)** — the emotional or conceptual direction it represents  

These dimensions allow you to **choose the right line** for the right purpose — whether you’re writing a homepage hero section, running a paid campaign, or sending an onboarding email.
