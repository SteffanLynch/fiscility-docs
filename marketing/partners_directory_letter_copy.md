Subject: Featured on Fiscility — Financial Professionals We Admire

Hi [Name],

I’m Steffan, founder of Fiscility — a platform that helps people gain clarity and insight into their finances through automated reports and analysis.

I came across your work and was genuinely impressed by how you approach [specific theme — e.g., small-business accounting / financial coaching / client education]. It aligns closely with Fiscility’s philosophy of clarity, simplicity, and thoughtful financial understanding.

Because of that, we’ve added you to our Fiscility Partners Directory — a curated list of professionals and services we consider reputable and non-competing with our mission.
Your profile is live here:

]]

If you’d like, you can reply to confirm or adjust any details — your bio, image, or website — and we’ll update it immediately.

Once you’ve confirmed you’re happy with your profile, I’d also love to explore a possible partnership — so our members can find and connect with you directly as a trusted referral option.

Warm regards,
Steffan Lynch
Founder, Fiscility
