## 🎨 Reddit Post Anatomy for Fiscility

### **Template 1: Problem/Pain Post**
```
Title: [Provocative problem statement in user's language]
Example: "Why checking your bank balance 10x a day increases anxiety instead of reducing it"

Body:
[Personal observation or story - 1-2 sentences]
I used to check my banking apps constantly—before purchases, after purchases, randomly throughout the day.

[The problem clearly stated - 2-3 sentences]
I realized I wasn't getting clarity, just snapshots. A balance doesn't tell you your burn rate, upcoming bills, or whether that purchase fits your cash flow.

[The insight or lesson - 2-3 sentences]
Real financial clarity comes from seeing patterns and context, not point-in-time numbers. You need to see: Where is my money going? What can I actually afford? Am I on track?

[Optional: Soft mention of solution]
That's why I started automating my financial reporting—daily summaries with context, not just balances.

[Question to drive engagement]
Has anyone else experienced this? How do you get actual financial visibility?
```

---

### **Template 2: Education/Insight Post**
```
Title: [Number + specific benefit]
Example: "The 3 financial metrics that actually matter (and why bank balances aren't one of them)"

Body:
[Hook - challenge common assumption]
Most people track the wrong numbers.

[The insight clearly]
Instead of checking your balance 10x a day, track these 3 metrics:

1. **Burn rate**: What you spend per day/week/month on average
2. **Runway**: How long your current savings will last at your burn rate
3. **Cash flow trend**: Whether you're trending up or down over time

[Why this matters]
These numbers tell you if you can afford something, when you need to course-correct, and whether you're improving—all without obsessing over every transaction.

[Optional: How to implement]
You can track these manually (spreadsheets) or automate them (which is what I do).

[Engagement question]
What metrics do you find most useful for financial clarity?
```

---

### **Template 3: Story/Journey Post**
```
Title: [Personal story format, relatable]
Example: "I stopped using spreadsheets for my finances. Here's what happened."

Body:
[The before state]
For years, I manually tracked every transaction in spreadsheets. I'd spend weekends categorizing, calculating, and trying to "understand" my finances.

[The turning point]
Then I realized I was spending hours each month just to get information I needed daily.

[The change]
I built an automated reporting system that sends me a daily email with:
- Current balance across all accounts
- Spending vs income (week over week)
- Burn rate and runway
- Anomalies or unusual transactions

[The after state]
Now I spend 2 minutes a day reviewing one email instead of 5+ hours a month updating spreadsheets.

[The insight]
Financial clarity shouldn't require manual labor. Automation doesn't make you lazy—it makes you informed.

[Engagement]
Anyone else automate their financial tracking? What tools or systems do you use?
```

---

### **Template 4: Tool Showcase (for r/PFtools)**
```
Title: [Direct but humble]
Example: "Built a tool for automated daily financial reports. Feedback welcome."

Body:
[The problem you solved]
I was tired of manually checking multiple banking apps and spreadsheets to understand my financial situation.

[What you built]
I created Fiscility—a system that:
- Connects to all your accounts (bank, credit, investment)
- Generates automated daily reports via email
- Shows key metrics: burn rate, runway, cash flow trends
- Highlights anomalies and unusual transactions

[How it works - technical level appropriate for audience]
Uses Plaid for secure account connections, runs daily aggregation, and generates customized reports based on your goals.

[Current state]
Currently in beta testing with ~50 users. Looking for feedback on features, usability, and what else people want to see.

[Ask for feedback]
What features would you want in an automated financial report? What are you currently using?

[Optional: Link]
Happy to share more details for anyone interested: [fiscility.com]

## 🎓 Appendix: Full Post Examples by Pillar

### **Example 1: Problem Post (r/personalfinance)**

**Title:** "Why knowing your bank balance doesn't actually give you financial clarity"

**Body:**
I used to check my bank balance multiple times a day. Before buying coffee. After getting paid. Randomly at 11pm.

I thought I was being financially responsible.

But here's what I realized: A balance is just a snapshot. It doesn't tell you:
- What's your average daily/weekly spending? (Burn rate)
- How long will your savings last at your current pace? (Runway)
- Are you trending up or down over time? (Cash flow direction)
- Is that purchase you're considering actually affordable in context?

Real financial clarity comes from seeing patterns and context, not point-in-time numbers.

That's why I started tracking different metrics automatically:
- Burn rate (what I spend per week on average)
- Runway (how many weeks my savings will last)
- Cash flow trend (am I improving or declining?)

These numbers tell me if I can afford something, when to course-correct, and whether I'm making progress—all without obsessing over every transaction or manually updating spreadsheets.

Has anyone else experienced this disconnect between "knowing your balance" and actually understanding your financial situation? What metrics do you track?

---

### **Example 2: Story Post (r/financialindependence)**

**Title:** "I automated my FI tracking. Here's what happened to my progress."

**Body:**
For 3 years, I manually updated a spreadsheet every month to track my FI progress. Net worth, savings rate, projected FI date. The works.

Then I realized: I was spending 2-3 hours every month just to get a single snapshot of where I stood.

So I automated it.

**What I built:**
A system that:
- Pulls all account balances daily (checking, savings, investment, debt)
- Calculates net worth, savings rate, and "runway" automatically
- Projects FI date based on current trajectory
- Sends me a daily email summary (takes 2 min to review)

**What changed:**
1. I went from monthly check-ins to daily awareness
2. I caught savings rate dips in real-time (not a month later)
3. I saw the impact of spending decisions immediately
4. My projected FI date became a living number, not a static goal
5. I saved 30+ hours/year on manual tracking

**The unexpected benefit:**
Daily visibility made me more intentional, not more obsessed. I check my finances less because I trust the system to alert me if something's off.

If you're tracking FI manually, consider automating at least some of it. Your time is worth more than spreadsheet maintenance.

Anyone else automate their FI tracking? What tools or systems are you using?

### **Example 3: Education Post (r/povertyfinance)**

**Title:** "The 3 numbers that matter more than your bank balance"

**Body:**
If you're living paycheck to paycheck, checking your balance constantly doesn't help—it just creates stress.

Here are 3 numbers that actually give you clarity:

**1. Burn Rate (Daily/Weekly spending average)**
- Add up everything you spent last month
- Divide by 30 (or divide last week by 7)
- This tells you: "I spend about $X per day to live"

**2. Runway (How long your money will last)**
- Take your current savings
- Divide by your burn rate
- This tells you: "I have X days/weeks before I'm in trouble"

**3. Trend (Are you going up or down?)**
- Compare this month to last month
- Are you spending more or less?
- This tells you: "Am I improving or declining?"

**Why these matter:**
- Your balance changes constantly (doesn't help with decisions)
- These 3 numbers tell you if you can afford something
- They show you if you need to course-correct NOW
- You can track them in your head (no app required)

**Free way to track:**
- Use your bank's transaction history
- Set a calendar reminder once a week
- Or use a simple notes app to jot down the 3 numbers

Financial clarity isn't about tracking every penny. It's about knowing these 3 numbers at all times.

What numbers do you track to feel in control of your finances?

### **Example 4: Tool Showcase (r/PFtools)**

**Title:** "Built a tool for automated daily financial reports (feedback welcome)"

**Body:**
**The problem:**
I was tired of manually checking 5+ banking apps and updating spreadsheets just to understand my financial situation.

**What I built:**
Fiscility—automated financial reporting via daily email.

**How it works:**
1. Securely connects to your accounts (bank, credit, investment) via Plaid
2. Runs daily aggregation and analysis
3. Sends you a customized email report with:
   - Total balance across all accounts
   - Spending vs income (week over week)
   - Burn rate (average daily spend)
   - Runway (how long savings will last)
   - Anomalies or unusual transactions
   - Cash flow trend (up/down)

**Philosophy:**
Financial clarity without manual effort. You get the visibility of spreadsheets without the maintenance.

**Current state:**
Beta testing with ~50 users. It's free during beta. Looking for feedback on:
- What metrics matter most to you?
- What else would you want in a daily financial report?
- What tools are you currently using?

**Tech stack (for the curious):**
- Plaid API for secure account connections
- Python data pipeline for aggregation
- SendGrid for email delivery
- User-customizable report templates

Not trying to replace budgeting tools—just provide effortless daily financial awareness.

If you're interested in trying it or have questions, happy to chat: fiscility.com
