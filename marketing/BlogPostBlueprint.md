## 🧩 1. Core Principles

1. **SEO & AI Together:**
   Optimise for **traditional SEO (Google, Bing)** *and* for **AI retrieval and summarisation**.

   * Do *regular* on-page SEO (keywords, meta, headings).
   * Don’t block LLM crawlers (e.g. OpenAI, Anthropic, Perplexity).
   * Use **server-side rendering (SSR)** — *not* client-side JavaScript.
   * Avoid gating valuable content behind logins or modals.

2. **Human-first, Machine-readable:**
   Write for clarity, structure, and usefulness — *never keyword stuffing*.
   LLMs prioritise well-structured, semantically rich text with clear sections and natural tone.

3. **Trust = Rank:**
   AI and search systems favour **Expertise, Experience, Authoritativeness, and Trustworthiness (E-E-A-T)**.
   Support every claim with data, examples, or credible citations.

4. **Consistency Over Virality:**
   Publish consistently (minimum **2 posts/month**) rather than chasing trends.
   Authority compounds with frequency and freshness.

## ✍️ 3. Writing Rules (Content & Diction)

### ✅ Do

* Use **clear, precise, professional language** — friendly but authoritative.
* Write in **British English** (consistent with your brand).
* Open with **a strong problem statement or relatable scenario**.
* Keep **sentences under 20 words** where possible.
* Use **short paragraphs (2–4 lines)** for readability.
* Use **active voice** and **second-person (“you”)** when appropriate.
* Write at a reading level accessible to 12-year-olds — use simple language, short sentences, and clear explanations. Make content easy and smooth to read and digest.
* Sprinkle **strategic keywords naturally** into headers and first 100 words.
* Use **real numbers, metrics, or examples** wherever possible.
* Stay focused on the main theme or subject — avoid too many tangents or going too deep in the weeds so readers don't forget what they're reading about.
* End with a **CTA (Call to Action):**

  * “Try Fiscility free for 7 days.”
  * “Explore how automated financial reports can save you 10 hours/month.”

### 🚫 Don’t

* Write purely for algorithms — *you’re writing for clarity.*
* Overuse jargon unless explained.
* Write fluffy introductions or generic “what is…” content.
* Hide value behind long preambles. Deliver insight **immediately**.
* Stuff internal links unnaturally.
* Forget the CTA — every post must connect back to **Fiscility**’s purpose.
* Use emojis in the body text, headers, or subheaders — keep content professional and clean.

## 🌐 6. AI Search Optimisation Rules

> *AI crawlers are different from Google — they “read” structure and reputation.*

1. **Do not block LLM crawlers** in `robots.txt`

   ```
   User-agent: GPTBot
   Allow: /
   User-agent: Google-Extended
   Allow: /
   ```
2. **Avoid JavaScript-only rendering** — use SSR or static HTML.
3. **Prioritise brand mentions over backlinks:**

   * Get “Fiscility” mentioned on reputable sites where researchers would expect it.
   * Examples: Wikipedia, Crunchbase, Product Hunt, Reddit threads, news coverage.
4. **Use structured data & citations** — LLMs index factual statements with clear sources.
5. **Maintain consistent brand voice and phrasing:**

   * Helps AI link “Fiscility” with “financial clarity,” “automated reports,” “decision confidence.”
6. **Publish original, high-context answers** to **prompt-like questions**, e.g.

   * “How can I automate my spending reports?”
   * “What’s my true discretionary income?”
   * “How long will my money last?”
     These are the types of **LLM retrievable Q&A** that will appear in AI answers.
