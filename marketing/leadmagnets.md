## 🧭 8. Guiding Principles

1. **Lead with Value.** Every magnet must *teach, reveal, or show* something useful before selling.  
2. **Clarity First.** The user should leave smarter — not just subscribed.  
3. **Low Friction → High Conversion.** Start with instant downloads, then nurture toward higher involvement (quizzes, demos).  
4. **Always Tag & Track.** Every magnet must apply a CRM tag so you can measure performance and trigger automation.  
5. **One Next Step.** Every magnet should lead to *one clear CTA* — “Get a Sample Report” or “Start Free Trial.”  
6. **Match Tone to Theme.** Educational → calm and professional. Interactive → playful and modern. Partner → confident and B2B.  

---

## 🧠 9. Core Philosophy

Fiscility’s marketing doesn’t push budgeting — it *offers clarity.*  
Your lead magnets must **demonstrate that difference**.

> “Clarity attracts confidence. Confidence creates conversion.”

If every free resource delivers a moment of clarity, the product will sell itself.
