This is an excellent pivot. Partnering with financial service providers for a recurring commission referral program (often called an Agency Partner or Referral Partner program) is highly sustainable and valuable because it leverages trust those professionals have already built.
The key to finding these partners is to move beyond general B2B outreach and focus on their professional communities and pain points.
Here is a breakdown of the best sources and methods for finding these financial service partners:
1. Professional Directories & Niche-Specific Platforms
These resources allow you to target professionals based on their service niche, which aligns directly with Fiscility's value proposition.
| Target Partner | Source/Platform | Search Strategy |
|---|---|---|
| Accountants / CPAs | AICPA (US) or local country/state CPA directories, QuickBooks ProAdvisor Directory, Xero Advisor Directory. | Look for firms that advertise "Advisory Services," "Cloud Accounting," or "Virtual CFO." These firms are more tech-forward and actively look for tools to enhance client relationships beyond just tax/compliance. |
| Fractional CFOs | Fractional CFO Marketplace Platforms (e.g., Paro, SuperCFO), LinkedIn search for "Fractional CFO" + "SMB." | Target individuals who manage a portfolio of small business clients and need a streamlined, non-enterprise reporting solution (which Fiscility provides). |
| Financial Advisors / RIAs | RIA directories (e.g., Fiduciary search, NAPFA), FinTech-focused Wealth Management blogs. | Search for advisors who serve "young professionals," "high-income earners," or focus on "holistic financial planning." Fiscility acts as a powerful client engagement and data-gathering tool for them. |
| Bookkeepers | Bookkeeping Association Directories (e.g., AIPB, ICB), Bookkeeping-focused Facebook Groups. | Look for bookkeepers who state they offer "management reporting" or "budgeting" services, as Fiscility automates this work. |
2. Professional Social & Community Platforms
Leverage platforms where these professionals discuss technology and their clients' pain points.
| Platform | Strategy | The Fiscility Angle |
|---|---|---|
| LinkedIn Groups | Search for groups like "SaaS for Accountants," "Fractional CFO Network," or "FinTech for Financial Advisors." | Do not cold pitch in the group. Instead, join the conversation, offer value, and identify top contributors who talk about the challenges of client reporting, visibility, or affordability. Then, use your connection template. |
| Industry Events / Webinars | Attend online conferences or webinars hosted by accounting or financial planning software companies (like QuickBooks, Xero, etc.). | The attendees of these events are your target partners. You can look up who attended on LinkedIn or reach out to event organizers for partner-level sponsor lists. |
| Software Integrations | Look up the Integration Partners of accounting software (e.g., Xero App Store, QuickBooks App Store). | The consulting firms and advisors listed there are already committed to using and recommending third-party softwareâ€”making them prime targets for your integration pitch. |
3. Targeted Outreach: The "Value-First" Pitch
When you reach out, you need to emphasize how Fiscility helps their business, not just their clients. Your current LinkedIn templates are excellent for this, but here's how to sharpen the pitch for a recurring commission model:
The Value Proposition for the Partner (Your Focus)
 * Reduce Manual Effort: "Fiscility automates the weekly/monthly reporting dashboards your clients constantly ask for, freeing your team for higher-value strategic work."
 * Increase Revenue & Retention: "Offering Fiscility as a value-add client perk strengthens your service stickiness and provides a passive, recurring revenue stream."
 * Client Visibility: "Gives you and your clients instant, clean visibility between quarterly meetings, improving client communication."
Revised Follow-up/InMail Examples (using recurring commission hook):
| Target | Pitch Angle |
|---|---|
| Fractional CFO | "Thanks for connecting, [Name]. We built Fiscility to give SMB clients affordable, automated reporting so you can jump straight into strategy. Many fractional CFOs use it to streamline their monthly client-check-ins and earn a recurring revenue share by providing it as a value-add tool. Would you be open to a 10-minute demo to see how it fits your stack?" |
| Accountant / CPA | "Thanks for connecting, [Name]. We find clients often drop off after tax season because they lack clear, continuous financial visibility. Fiscility automates simple reports for them. We offer a structured referral program where your firm earns a lifetime recurring commission on subscriptions, turning a client need into a sustained revenue stream for you. Worth a quick chat?" |
By systematically targeting these professional communities and offering a compelling value proposition and a recurring commission structure, you will build a scalable and sustainable partner pipeline.
