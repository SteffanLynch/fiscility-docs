Hey {first name}, 

At Fisclity, deliver automated and scheduled financial reports straight into your inbox with zero ongoing effort or technical complexity.

We're giving away 3 months free access to 30 people. Iâ€™ve had a some successful cases but want to get a couple more scenarios to prove it works across multiple scenarios.

Hey {first name},

Just wanted to follow up in case our last email got lost.

Fiscility is not a budgeting app. We deliver financial clarity for those who need it the most. Every day, week and month, you'll get your key financial insights sent straight to your inbox.

No logging in. No remembering. No effort.

Let me know if you want a 3 month trial to see what you think and we can get you set up in 2 minutes.

Best,
Steffan Lynch
