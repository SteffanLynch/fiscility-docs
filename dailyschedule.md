## **THE HONEST TRUTH**

At your stage:
- **Product doesn't need to be perfect** - it needs to work well enough
- **Brand doesn't matter yet** - distribution matters
- **Content is a luxury** - unless it converts immediately
- **Strategy is premature** - you need data first
- **Your job is to NOT DIE** - that means revenue

**Spend 70-80% of your time on activities that could result in revenue in the next 30 days.**

Everything else is a distraction dressed up as "important work."

---

## **KEY CHANGES:**
- ✅ Monday is now B2C outreach (not paid ads)
- ✅ Paid ads moved to Saturday (optimization) and Sunday (setup)
- ✅ Paid ads are secondary tasks, not primary focus
- ✅ B2C outreach gets full day of attention like B2B does

**Does this work better for your current capital situation?**
