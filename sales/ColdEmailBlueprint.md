## 1. Sequence Strategy and Timing

| Email | Timing | Core Goal | What They Feel |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Email 1** | Day 1 | **Start a conversation.** Show you understand their problem and mention you have something that might help. | **Frustrated → Interested** |
| **Email 2** | 2-3 Days Later | **Build trust.** Share a quick win or insight. Show this won't waste their time. | **Unsure → Curious** |
| **Email 3** | 4-7 Days Later | **Gentle close.** Let them know you're moving on soon. Give one last chance to connect. | **Uncertain → Ready to decide** |

## 2. Core Rules & Guidelines

### A. Writing Rules
* **Tone:** Write like you're talking to a friend. Be helpful, not pushy.
* **Length:** Keep it short. People should read it in 10-15 seconds.
* **Paragraphs:** 1-2 sentences max. Use lots of white space.
* **Personal touch:** Always use their first name. Mention something specific about their company or role.
* **NO LINKS:** Never include clickable links. They hurt deliverability and trigger spam filters. Instead, ask for a reply or tell them you'll send the resource if they're interested.

### B. Structure for Every Email

| Element | Purpose | How to Do It |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Subject Line** | Get them to open. Be specific and personal. | **Keep it under 6 words.** Use their name or company. Make it about them, not you. |
| **Opening Line** | Show you get their world. | Reference something real about them. Skip the "My name is..." intro. |
| **Body** | Talk about their problem. Show what changes when it's solved. Mention you have something that helps. | Focus on their pain and the better future. Use **bold** for key points. Keep sentences short. |
| **Call-to-Action** | Ask for a reply. | Simple question. "Want me to send this over?" or "Should I share what we found?" |
| **Signature** | Keep it minimal. | Just your name, title, and company. Nothing else. |

## 3. What Each Email Does

| Email | What to Include | How to Ask |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Email 1** | **The problem they have.** Describe the pain. Show you understand. Say you have a resource that helps. Keep it light and conversational. | "Interested? Just reply and I'll send it your way." |
| **Email 2** | **A quick win.** Reply to Email 1 to keep the thread going. Share one useful tip or insight for free. Mention others like them found it helpful. | "Want the full version? Let me know and I'll get it to you." |
| **Email 3** | **Gentle goodbye.** Say you're wrapping up and moving on. Give them one more chance. Remind them what they're missing out on. Add soft urgency: you're cleaning up your list or closing this project soon. | "Last chance - should I send this before I close your file?" |

## 4. Key Rules Summary

### DO:
- Write like a human
- Use their first name
- Keep it super short
- Make it about them, not you
- Use soft urgency (closing files, wrapping up, limited availability)
- Ask for a reply instead of clicks

### DON'T:
- Use hyperlinks (kills deliverability)
- Write long paragraphs
- Sound like a salesperson
- Use marketing buzzwords
- Make big promises
- Add extra calls-to-action

### Urgency & Scarcity (Keep It Light):
- "Wrapping up this project this week"
- "Cleaning up my list soon"
- "Only reaching out to a few companies"
- "This is the last time I'll mention it"
- "Moving on to other accounts after Friday"

These create gentle pressure without being aggressive or fake.

## 5. The Psychology

**Email 1:** "I see you. I have something that might help."

**Email 2:** "Here's proof this works. It won't waste your time."

**Email 3:** "I'm moving on. This is your last shot."

The goal is connection, not conversion. You want replies, not clicks.
