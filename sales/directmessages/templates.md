## Accountants and Bookkeepers

Hey Dorothea — Steffan here, founder of Fiscility.

We partner with a few accounting practices to give their clients automated financial reports between meetings — adds recurring revenue for you, no extra hours.

Thought BDEM Services might be a good fit. Worth a quick look?

## Content Creators and Potential Affiliates

Hey Thamina — Steffan here, founder of Fiscility 👋

I love the work you’re doing with The Sheconomist — your audience seems perfect for what we built.

It’s a personal-finance tool that gives people automated reports + insights (no tracking spreadsheets).

We’ve just opened an affiliate program — creators earn 100 % of the first month’s subscription per referral.

Want me to send you free access so you can try it first?

## Financial Writers, Bloggers and Journalists

Hey {{first_name}} — Steffan here, founder of Fiscility 👋

I built it because I couldn’t find a personal-finance tool that gave the same clarity we have in business analytics.

It turns your bank data into clean, automatic financial reports — no spreadsheets or manual categorising needed.

Thought you might find it useful personally or for a future piece.

Want me to send you a link to try it?
