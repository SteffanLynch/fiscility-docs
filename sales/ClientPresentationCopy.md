### **Slide 1: Intro — Why I’m Recommending This**

**Header:**
Why I’ve Started Recommending Fiscility to My Clients

**Body Copy:**
I work with a lot of clients who want more clarity and control over their finances — without having to build complicated spreadsheets or log into 5 different banking apps.

I recently started using a tool called **Fiscility** that helps solve exactly that — and I think it could help you too.

It’s simple, powerful, and made specifically for small business owners who want insights without the overwhelm.

### **Slide 2: The Problem You Might Be Facing**

**Header:**
Most People Don’t Know Where Their Money Is Really Going

**Bullets:**

* You’re managing multiple accounts and transactions every month
* You have no simple way to see trends or track cash flow
* Reports from your bank or accounting software are hard to understand
* You often find out what’s happening *after* the fact — instead of in real time

**Visual idea:**
Messy spreadsheet or graph full of line items

Fiscility Gives You the Clarity You’ve Been Missing

* Automatically track your income, spending, and cash flow
* Get weekly and monthly financial reports via email or SMS

### **Slide 4: The Benefits You’ll See Immediately**

**Header:**
More Control. Less Guesswork.

**Bullets:**

* Save time every week — no more digging through statements
* Make smarter financial decisions faster
* Catch cash flow issues early, before they become problems
* Feel more confident in your financial direction
* I still stay in the loop — but now you’re empowered between check-ins
