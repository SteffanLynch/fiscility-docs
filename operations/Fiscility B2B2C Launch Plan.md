## EXACT OUTREACH BREAKDOWN

### LINKEDIN CONNECTION REQUESTS
**WHO:** New prospects you researched that morning
**WHEN:** 2:00 PM daily
**MESSAGE:** *"Hi [Name], I help financial consultants add recurring revenue streams for their SMB clients. Mind if we connect?"*

### LINKEDIN FOLLOW-UP MESSAGES  
**WHO:** People who accepted your connection request 2+ days ago
**WHEN:** 2:15 PM daily
**MESSAGE:** *"Thanks for connecting, [Name]. I saw your post about [specific recent post]. I help fractional CFOs earn 40% recurring commissions by offering financial analytics to their clients. Worth a 15-minute call this week?"*

### COLD EMAILS
**WHO:** Prospects you researched yesterday and found email addresses for
**WHEN:** 2:30 PM daily
**SUBJECT:** "40% recurring commissions for [Company Name]"
**MESSAGE:** 
```
Hi [Name],

I help fractional CFOs add $1000-3000/month in recurring revenue.

Simple process:
• You introduce our financial analytics platform to existing clients
• We handle all setup and support
• You keep 40% of monthly subscriptions

Worth a 15-minute call this week?

Best,
[Your name]
```

### PHONE CALLS (Phase 2 & 3 only)
**WHO:** People who responded positively to LinkedIn/email but haven't booked a demo
**WHEN:** 2:45 PM daily
**SCRIPT:** *"Hi [Name], this is [Your name]. You mentioned interest in the partner program. Do you have 2 minutes for me to explain how other fractional CFOs are adding $2000+ monthly with this?"*

---

## REALISTIC CONVERSION RATES

### Phase 1 Assumptions
- **LinkedIn connection acceptance:** 40% (6 out of 15 daily requests)
- **Email response rate:** 10% (0.5 out of 5 daily emails)
- **Follow-up to demo conversion:** 15% (1 demo per week from follow-ups)
- **Demo to partner conversion:** 60% (2 partners from 3 demos)

### Weekly Math Check (Phase 1)
- Send 105 LinkedIn requests → 42 accept → 6 follow-up conversations → 1 demo
- Send 35 emails → 3-4 responses → 1 demo  
- **Total demos per week:** 2-3
- **Partners signed:** 1-2 per week

### Why These Goals Are Achievable
- **8-10 partners in 35 days** = 0.25 partners per day average
- **20-25 client presentations total** = 2-3 presentations per partner (very reasonable)
- **6-10 paying customers** = 60-100% conversion from presentations (realistic for good fits)
