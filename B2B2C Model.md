## Why the change of focus from B2C to B2B

- You value systemised and efficient growth over “growth at all costs.”
- You’re a solo founder without a marketing machine or big budget.
- You want scalability with less manual effort.
- You prefer strategic leverage over grinding for individual signups.
- One partnership = 10-50 clients vs. individual B2C acquisition
- Partners do the selling, onboarding, and support - you focus on product
- Systematized growth: Predictable client acquisition through established channels
- Less operational overhead: Partners handle client questions and training
- You're positioned as a B2B tool already with professional naming
- Less competition in B2B fintech vs. saturated B2C market
- Higher switching costs - B2B clients are stickier


## Business Model

- Keep your existing B2C pricing ($0-$79/month)
- Partners sell at full price to their clients
- Partners earn 20-30% commission on all payments
- You handle billing, partners get monthly commission payouts

Example:
Client pays $49/month for Analyst plan
Partner earns $12.25/month (25% commission)
You keep $36.75/month (75%)
Partner gets recurring revenue as long as client stays active


“Earn 25% every month for as long as your client uses Fiscility — no caps. A partner with 50 clients can earn $X/month in recurring revenue.”
