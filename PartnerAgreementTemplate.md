**1.2 Non-Exclusivity.** Appointment is non-exclusive. Fiscility may appoint others and sell directly.

**1.3 Relationship; No Authority.** The Parties are independent contractors. This Agreement does not create a partnership, joint venture, franchise, fiduciary, or agency relationship. Partner has no authority to bind Fiscility or make commitments on Fiscility’s behalf and will not represent otherwise.
