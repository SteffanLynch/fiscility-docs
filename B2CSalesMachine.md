## The Emails (Finalised)
### Email 1 (Day 0) ‚Äì Initial Pitch

Subject: Your finances, under control (without spreadsheets)

Hi [FirstName],  

I work with professionals and business owners who want a clear, simple view of their money without the hassle of spreadsheets.  

I built Fiscility ‚Äî it connects your bank accounts, analyses your finances, and sends you weekly reports by email or SMS. Think of it like having your own financial analyst on autopilot.  

Plans start at $29/month. Early users also get a free personalised Financial Clarity Report when they sign up.  

Would you like me to send you the signup link?  

‚Äì Steffan  

### Email 2 (Day 3) ‚Äì Scarcity + Proof

Subject: Quick follow-up ‚Äî spots are limited

Hi [FirstName],  

Just following up ‚Äî I‚Äôm capping this launch at 100 paying users with locked-in pricing.  

One new member last week spotted over $600/month in ‚Äúinvisible‚Äù expenses from their first weekly report.  

Do you want me to hold a spot for you?  

‚Äì Steffan  

### Email 3 (Day 7) ‚Äì Close the Loop

Subject: Should I close your spot?

Hi [FirstName],  

I only have a handful of founder spots left. If you‚Äôre not interested, I‚Äôll free your place for someone else.  

But if you‚Äôd like to lock in pricing and get the free Financial Clarity Report, I‚Äôd be happy to send you the signup link.  

‚Äì Steffan

## üí¨ FAQ RESPONSE TEMPLATES (COPY-PASTE)

**"How does it work?"**
"Simple process: You connect your bank accounts (same security as Venmo/Robinhood), I analyze 3 months of spending data, then send you a report showing patterns and optimization opportunities. Takes 5 minutes to set up, report delivered in 24 hours."

**"Is it secure?"**  
"Yes - uses Plaid integration (same system used by Robinhood, Venmo, most fintech apps). I never see your login credentials, only categorized transaction data. Same security standards as your banking apps."

**"How much does it cost?"**
"Free to try - you get basic categorization and one analysis report. Paid version ($29/month) adds automated monthly reports, spending alerts, and trend tracking. Most people try free first to see if it's useful."

**"What makes this different from Mint?"**
"Much more detailed categorization and actual insights. Mint shows you where money went, but this shows you WHY patterns happen and specific steps to optimize. Plus automated delivery - no logging in to check."
