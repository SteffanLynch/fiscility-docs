# Fiscility Affiliate Program

## Business Model
- Keep your existing B2C pricing ($0-$79/month)
- Affiliates promote at full price to their audience
- **Affiliates earn the value of the first 2 months** when a referred customer stays subscribed for 3 months
- Simple payout structure - no recurring commissions, but higher upfront value
- You handle billing, affiliates get one-time commission payouts after 3-month milestone

**Example:**
- Client pays $49/month for Analyst plan
- After 3 months of active subscription, affiliate earns $98 (2 months value)
- You keep ongoing revenue after payout
- Clear milestone = higher commitment from affiliates to refer quality customers

*"Earn up to $158 per successful referral ($79 x 2 months for CFO plan). An affiliate with 25 successful referrals per quarter can earn $3,950+ in quarterly payouts."*
